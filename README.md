# CryptoHelper
Little assortment of some functions I wrote for my cryptography class to help with understanding larger problems.

These are meant to aid you in your learning about Cryptography, not to be a shortcut for your homework. Please try and use these to check your work and to help with more complex problems as you learn more in your class. If you don't understand the concept or math behind something in my code, I would suggest asking your professor for help. :)

If you use this library, please cite accordingly not only for me, but for your own academic integrity. Please include a link to this repo in the comments or if you used it in a written homework, please note the repo there too. 

PLEASE report any issues and I will fix them, feedback is always good!
